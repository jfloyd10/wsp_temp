# CLAUDE.md — Wholesale Settlement Portal (Demo/Pilot)

## Project Overview

This is a **working prototype** of a Wholesale Settlement Portal for **Southern Company**, built to demo to executives. It is **not production-ready** — the goal is to prove the concept of a unified customer-facing portal that consolidates settlement data from multiple legacy on-prem systems into a single view.

Southern Company is a large utility holding company in the Southeast US. Its retail operating subsidiaries include **Georgia Power**, **Mississippi Power**, and **Alabama Power**. The company pools all generation resources and dispatches them as one fleet; the monthly "Pool Bill" settles dollars across operating companies. Wholesale energy contracts, PPAs, and short-term deals are settled monthly by the Financial & Contract Services (FCS) team.

### Business Problem

- Dozens of siloed on-prem apps (settlement, gas accounting, coal accounting, pool bill, resource planning, budgeting, etc.)
- No enterprise data warehouse
- Customers currently have no self-service portal for viewing invoices or settlements
- The same "core" data layer should eventually feed both this portal **and** FERC/regulatory filings

### What This Demo Proves

1. Data from multiple source systems can be consolidated into one unified schema (already done — see DuckDB below).
2. An executive portal can surface invoices, line-item details, file attachments, and operational metrics from that unified layer — filterable by operating company, counterparty, and other dimensions.
3. The architecture is extensible toward a production "core data layer" strategy, including future customer-facing views with row-level security.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | Python 3.11+ / Django 5.x | Standard Django (no DRF needed for demo unless API endpoints are requested) |
| **Database** | DuckDB (file-based) | All source data already consolidated here. Use `duckdb` Python package as the query engine. For Django ORM models, use SQLite as the Django metadata DB; read DuckDB directly for business data via raw queries or a thin service layer. |
| **Frontend** | Django Templates + Bootstrap 5 (or Tailwind) | Keep it simple — server-rendered HTML. Use Chart.js or Recharts for any dashboards. |
| **Auth** | Django built-in auth | Simple username/password. All users see all data (executive view). No row-level scoping. |
| **File Storage** | BLOBs in DuckDB `invoice_file_attachments` table | Serve via Django view that streams bytes with correct Content-Type. |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Django ORM for auth only.** User accounts, sessions, and permissions live in SQLite via Django's standard ORM. Business data lives in DuckDB and is queried through a service layer.

2. **Service layer pattern.** Create a `services/duckdb_service.py` module that:
   - Opens a read-only DuckDB connection
   - Exposes methods like `get_invoices(filters)`, `get_invoice_detail(invoice_no)`, `get_attachment(invoice_no, file_name)`, etc.
   - All list/query methods accept optional filter kwargs: `operating_company`, `counterparty_id`, `source_system`, `source_type`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `status`
   - Returns Python dicts or dataclass instances (not Django model instances)

3. **Executive view — no row-level security.** All logged-in users see all data across all operating companies and counterparties. Every list view provides **filter dropdowns** for operating company, counterparty, source system, source type, date range, and status. Filters are passed as GET query parameters and applied dynamically in the service layer SQL via optional WHERE clauses.

4. **No REST API needed for demo.** Standard Django views returning HTML. If requested later, add DRF serializers on top of the same service layer.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install django duckdb

# Initialize Django
python manage.py migrate          # Creates SQLite for auth
python manage.py createsuperuser  # Admin/demo account

# Run
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## Coding Conventions

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Use type hints in the service layer.
- **Templates**: Use Django template inheritance. `base.html` defines blocks: `title`, `content`, `extra_js`.
- **SQL**: Write all DuckDB queries in `duckdb_service.py` using parameterized queries (never string interpolation with user input).
- **Error handling**: Wrap DuckDB calls in try/except; return empty results on failure with logging.
- **Date formatting**: Display all dates as `MMM YYYY` (e.g., `Jan 2025`) unless day precision is needed.
- **Currency formatting**: Use locale-aware formatting or `${:,.2f}` pattern. All amounts are USD.
- **Naming**: snake_case for Python, kebab-case for CSS classes, camelCase for JS.

---

## Security Notes (Demo Scope)

- **No row-level security in this demo.** All logged-in users see all data. This is intentional — the demo is presented from an executive/admin perspective.
- Use Django's `@login_required` decorator on all views to prevent unauthenticated access.
- CSRF protection is enabled by default — keep it on.
- **Future production note:** Row-level scoping by `counterparty_id` should be added when this becomes a customer-facing portal. The service layer's filter-based architecture makes this straightforward — just make `counterparty_id` a required (non-optional) parameter for customer-role users.

---

## Future / Out of Scope for Demo

- REST API layer (DRF) for mobile or SPA frontends
- FERC/regulatory filing module (same core data, different views)
- Real authentication (SSO/SAML with corporate IdP)
- Migration from DuckDB to a proper data warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks, etc.)
- Role-based access control (executive vs. customer views with counterparty-scoped row-level security)
- Email notifications for new invoices
- Audit logging
- Data refresh pipeline from legacy source systems

## LLM Assistant Notes

When generating code for this project:

1. **Always use the service layer** — never put raw DuckDB SQL in views or templates.
2. **All views show all data by default** — no row-level security. Filters (operating company, counterparty, source system, source type, date range, status) are optional and passed as GET query params.
3. **Build filters dynamically in SQL** — the service layer should construct WHERE clauses from a `filters: dict` parameter, only adding conditions for keys that are present. Use parameterized queries — never string-interpolate user input.
4. **Populate filter dropdowns from data** — query distinct values from DuckDB for each filter dimension. Cache these if performance matters, but for the demo, querying each page load is fine.
5. **The DuckDB file path** should be configurable via `settings.py` (e.g., `DUCKDB_PATH = BASE_DIR / 'data' / 'wholesale.duckdb'`).
6. **DuckDB connections are cheap** — open per-request in the service layer, don't try to pool them.
7. **For the demo, seed data matters** — if the DuckDB file doesn't exist or is empty, provide a management command to generate realistic sample data.
8. **Keep the UI professional but simple** — this is an executive demo for a utility company. Use a clean, corporate color scheme (Southern Company brand blue: `#00205B`, accent: `#6CACE4`). No flashy animations.
9. **Chart.js is preferred** for any data visualizations in templates.
